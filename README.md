# Rock-Paper-Scissors
This is a very simple application I made using React.js.



# How To play
## Installation
To play the rock paper scissors game there is no need to download the actual code but if you want to here are the steps.
- `$ Git clone https://github.com/rellison27/React-Paper-Scissors.git`
- Or you can click the Green 'Download' button then proceed to extract the files.
- Follow bullet two and beyond in "Playing without downloading".

## Playing without downloading (This function is not possible at the moment because I used a local server to host it..sorry)
** No Rock & Roll !!** :(...yet
